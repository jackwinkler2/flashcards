# Web Development Project 3 - *Penguin Flashcards*

Submitted by: **Jack Winkler**

This web app: **helps users learn more about penguins by scrolling through a series of flashcards and testing their knowledge**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The user can enter their guess into an input box *before* seeing the flipside of the card**
  - Application features a clearly labeled input box with a submit button where users can type in a guess
  - Clicking on the submit button with an **incorrect** answer shows visual feedback that it is wrong 
  -  Clicking on the submit button with a **correct** answer shows visual feedback that it is correct
- [x] **The user can navigate through an ordered list of cardss**
  - A forward/next button displayed on the card navigates to the next card in a set sequence when clicked
  - A previous/back button displayed on the card returns to the previous card in the set sequence when clicked
  - Both the next and back buttons should have some visual indication that the user is at the beginning or end of the list (for example, graying out and no longer being available to click), not allowing for wrap-around navigation

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] A counter displays the userâ€™s current and longest streak of correct responses
  - The current counter increments when a user guesses an answer correctly
  - The current counter resets to 0 when a user guesses an answer incorrectly
  - A separate counter tracks the longest streak, updating if the value of the current streak counter exceeds the value of the longest streak counter 

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Overall, this project went smoother than the last one, as I had any easier time with initial setup of my environment and file structure, but I also had to work with useState functions which were challenging, as well as the flipping animation which was challenging to format.

Additionally, setting up the input box and establishing my file structure so that the correct answers, border colors and streaks trackers was challenging with passing Props and using useState.
